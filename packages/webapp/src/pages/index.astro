<Layout title="Home">
  <p>Hi {Astro.locals.user && Astro.locals.user.name}!</p>
  <p>It's pretty empty here now, but eventually I would like this page to show 
    <ul>
      <li>Who is currently at the cabin</li>
      <li>Upcoming bookings for the cabin</li>
      <li>Recent photos / notes from the cabin's corkboard</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Thanks!</p>
</Layout>
